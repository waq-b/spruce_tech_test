# Completed Solution info

## setup & start backend

- `npm i`
- `npm run setup`
- `npm start`

## what I would add to my solution

All 3 problems have been solved, with more time to expand further i would:

- Improve styling with assets and animations, currently very simple and basic
- Add component testing using React Testing Library
- Add the ability to name each player and have a more robust stats and leaderboard system for multiple players
- Host the game on the backend so multiple clients can be opened and players do not have to play on a single client

some inline TODO comments were also added to the code where possible missing functionality would be implimented

# Tic-Tac-Toe

The below problems are to allow us a glimpse into your problem solving ability, style and current skill set. Please do problem 1, and optionally problem 2 or 3 depending on where you are most comfortable. We expect this test to take 2-3 hours, if you find yourself spending more than this do not aim to solve all 3 problems! We will not be judging based on number of problems completed only the style and thought process.

## Problems

### Problem 1

We have started a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe as outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) but we don't have anyone good enough to code to finish it!

- Please implement a complete basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- Please use React and TypeScript throughout, if you know TailwindCSS please expand on what is already provided, otherwise it is fine to use raw styling
- Both players will play out of the same application, it is sufficient to just switch the current player each time a move is played
- Once a game is completed, I should be able to start another game

### Problem 2

We are bored with the basic game now, can you make it so the board can be scaled to any size?

- Add some kind of input which allows me to change the board size
- The board size should be a number between 3 and 15

### Problem 3

We want to store game results in a database.

- create a simple backend server (using a simple generator provided by your IDE is fine)
- use any SQL/noSQL database to store the results
- return simple stats back to the front-end: number of win/losses for each player.

Simplification for the task:

- do not use database migration tools, just an SQL or other script to create tables is fine
- add comments about what you were thinking about but didnâ€™t implement because of restrictions
- host the project on your local machine, optional hosting in a public place is fine
- optionally create a Dockerfile to build both back-end and front-end. Do not create any deployment scripts, if it's not necessary.
- optional tests are welcome

## Quickstart

- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

# Solution info

## start & setup backend

- `npm i`
- `npm run setup`
- `npm start`

## what I would add to my solution

All 3 problems have been solved, but if I was not timeboxing this task to 2-3 hours and had the freedom to expand much further i would:

some inline TODO comments were also added to the code where possible missing functionality would be implimented

- Improve styling with assets and animations, currently very simple and basic
- Add component testing using React Testing Library
- Add the ability to name each player and have a more robust stats and leaderboard system for multiple players
